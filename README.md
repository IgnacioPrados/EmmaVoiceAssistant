## Description
Emma is a Virtual Voice Assistant on a Website. Recognize what the user is saying through the microphone and respond. Tell jokes, interesting facts, and more. It's just a matter of opening the mic and talking to her.

## Details
I developed this Web App with JavaScript. It recognizes the voice coming through your microphone, shows you what you are saying on the screen, and finally, according to the words you included in your sentence, Emma answers you, showing the interactions in the form of a chat, to see the whole conversation.

I did this project between July and August 2021. To listen to the user, use a package called SpeechRecognition. For the UI, I used a design style called #Neuromorphism, I really love it. It gives a modern touch to the web.
